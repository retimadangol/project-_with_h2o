# 2: Columnar Transformation and Row Filters
IPYTHON notebook “2. Columnar Transformation and Row Filters.ipynb” is the solution to this challenge.


# 3: Joins/Merges and Modeling
IPYTHON notebook “3. Joins_Merges and Modeling.ipynb” is the solution to this challenge.


# 4: NLP
IPYTHON notebook “4. NLP.ipynb” is the solution to this challenge.

# 5: Hyperparameter Search and Stacked Ensembles
IPYTHON notebook “5. Hyperparameter Search and Stacked Ensemblems.ipynb” is the solution to this challenge.
All the hyper parameters after the grid search were saved locally and zipped up.
•	GLM grid search was saved as: “grid_hyperparams_GLM.json”
•	GBM grid search was saved as: “grid_hyperparams_GBM.json”
•	Deep Learning grid search was saved as: “grid_hyperparams_dl.json”
Best model from each grid search were also saved as:
•	GLM model was saved as: “best_glm”
•	GBM model was saved as: “best_gbm”
•	Deep Learning model was saved as: “best_dl”

# 6: Save Model, Load Model, and Model Checkpointing
IPYTHON notebook “6. Save Model, Load Model, and Model Checkpointing.ipynb” is the solution to this challenge.
GBM model was saved on the local drive and was loaded back in the note book.
•	First gbm model: gbm_model
