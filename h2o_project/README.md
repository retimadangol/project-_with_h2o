## 2: Columnar Transformation and Row Filters


## 3: Joins/Merges and Modeling


## 4: NLP

## 5: Hyperparameter Search and Stacked Ensembles

All the hyper parameters after the grid search were saved locally and zipped up.  
  •	GLM grid search was saved as: “grid_hyperparams_GLM.json”  
  •	GBM grid search was saved as: “grid_hyperparams_GBM.json”  
  •	Deep Learning grid search was saved as: “grid_hyperparams_dl.json”  
Best model from each grid search were also saved as:  
  •	GLM model was saved as: “best_glm”  
  •	GBM model was saved as: “best_gbm”  
  •	Deep Learning model was saved as: “best_dl”  

## 6: Save Model, Load Model, and Model Checkpointing

GBM model was saved on the local drive and was loaded back in the note book.  
  •	First gbm model: gbm_model
